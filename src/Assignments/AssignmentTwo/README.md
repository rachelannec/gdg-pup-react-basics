# 2. Top 3 Major Projects Using Props

## Objective

Learn how to pass data using props by displaying three major projects in a React app.

### Folder Structure:

```
Assignments/AssignmentTwo/
  ├── AssignmentTwo.jsx
  ├── AssignmentTwo.css
```

### Steps:

1. **Create `AssignmentTwo.jsx`** to hold an array of project details.
2. **Create a separate component** to display individual project information.
3. **Pass project data as props** from the parent component to the child component.
4. **Render the project list dynamically** using the `.map()` method.
5. **Test the application** to ensure proper data rendering.

**Ruleset:** You may use routing (`react-router-dom`) or copy the relevant code from `App.jsx` to render the project.
