# 3. Fetching User Data with useEffect

## Objective

Fetch user data from an API using `useEffect` and display names and emails.

### Folder Structure:

```
Assignments/AssignmentThree/
  ├── AssignmentThree.jsx
  ├── AssignmentThree.css
```

### Steps:

1. **Create `AssignmentThree.jsx`** to handle fetching and displaying user data.
2. **Use `useEffect`** to trigger an API request when the component mounts.
3. **Fetch user data** from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.
4. **Handle errors** by catching API failures and displaying an error message.
5. **Render the list of users dynamically** with their names and emails.
6. **Test the application** to verify data fetching and rendering.

**Ruleset:** You may use routing (`react-router-dom`) or copy the relevant code from `App.jsx` to render the project.
