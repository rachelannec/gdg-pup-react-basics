# 4. Conditional Rendering: My Address

## Objective

Fetch and display an address from `https://psgc.cloud/api`, showing a loading message while fetching.

### Folder Structure:

```
Assignments/AssignmentFour/
  ├── AssignmentFour.jsx
  ├── AssignmentFour.css
```

### Steps:

1. **Create `AssignmentFour.jsx`** to manage fetching and displaying the address.
2. **Use `useEffect`** to fetch data when the component mounts.
3. **Fetch address data** from the API.
4. **Handle loading state** by displaying a loading message while fetching.
5. **Handle errors** by displaying an error message if fetching fails.
6. **Render the address dynamically** once the data is successfully retrieved.
7. **Test the application** to ensure conditional rendering works properly.

**Ruleset:** You may use routing (`react-router-dom`) or copy the relevant code from `App.jsx` to render the project.
