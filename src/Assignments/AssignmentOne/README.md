# 1. Increment-Decrement Counter

## Objective

Create a simple counter application using React's `useState` hook. The app should have buttons to increase and decrease the counter value, displaying the current count.

### Folder Structure:

```
Assignments/AssignmentOne/
  ├── AssignmentOne.jsx
  ├── AssignmentOne.css
```

### Steps:

1. **Create a React App**
2. **Create `AssignmentOne.jsx`** to handle the counter logic using state.
3. **Add event handlers** to increment and decrement the counter.
4. **Prevent negative values** by disabling the decrement button when the counter is at zero.
5. **Test the application** to ensure functionality.

**Ruleset:** You may use routing (`react-router-dom`) or copy the relevant code from `App.jsx` to render the project.
